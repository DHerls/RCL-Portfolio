			<p>Hello!  My name is Dan Herlihy and I am an undergraduate student at Penn State University.  I am currently planning on double-majoring in both Computer Science as well as Security and Risk Analysis and I am on track to graduate in the Spring of 2020.</p>
			<p>Ever since I was little, I've loved messing with computers.  In fact some of the earliest memories I have are of my Dad and I working on the family computer.  I also loved spies and secret codes as a kid.  As I grew older my love of computers and secret codes turned into a hobby of programming and an interest in encryption and information security.  When I was looking at colleges, I saw that Penn State would let me pursue both of my passions in addition to being a great school so I came here and I haven't looked back.  I hope to eventually work in the field of information security protecting data and making security as seamless as possible.  I hope to make security less of a hassle and more a normal part of our everyday lives.</p>
			<p>Since coming to Penn State, I've become heavily involved in THON, which is a student-run organization dedicated to raising money to assist the families of children affected by pediatric cancer.  I joined Springfield, which raises money for THON, my freshman year and at the end of my second semester I was chosen to be the Communications Chair for Springfield for the following year.  I also was selected to be a Technology Captain for overall THON which means I'll be able to put my abilities with computers to use benefiting a cause I'm passionate about.</p>
